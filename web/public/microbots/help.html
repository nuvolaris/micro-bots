          <p>You control your fighter writing a serverless action. You can start
            from some templates included in the UI. You can use the integrated
            editor to code your fighter.</p>
          <p>A serverless action is a function, written in either Javascript,
            Python or Go, that receive as input a json document and returns its
            answer in json. In each programming language the json is serialized and
            deserialized first in a data structure appropriate for you programming
            language. When you create a fighter a suitable example is provided.</p>
          <p>Each fighter will communicate with the action to receive orders. The
            action is invoked when an event occurr. In response to an event you
            return a list of orders, in the format described below.</p>
          <p>The fighter has an energy level that starts at 5 and decrease by one
            each time you are hit. When it reaches <code>0</code> you lose. You lose
            also if your controlling actions returns an error, so be careful in your
            coding.</p>
          <h2 id="events">Events</h2>
          <p>The fighter receive a message in the following format:</p>
          <pre><code>{
  &quot;event&quot;: &quot;idle&quot;,
  &quot;energy&quot;: 5,
  &quot;x&quot;: 110,
  &quot;y&quot;: 240,
  &quot;angle&quot;: 23
  &quot;tank_angle&quot;: 232,
  &quot;turret_angle&quot;: 150,
  &quot;enemy_spot&quot;: {},
  &quot;data&quot;: {}
}</code></pre>
          <ul>
            <li>The <code>event</code> can be:
              <ul>
                <li><code>idle</code>: the fighter has its order queue empty and and
                  asks for new orders</li>
                <li><code>enemy-spot</code>: the fighter has spotted the enemy and can
                  hit him firing</li>
                <li><code>hit</code>: the fighter was hit by an enemy bullet</li>
                <li><code>wall-collide</code>: the fighter collided with a wall</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the position in the
              battlefiel,</li>
            <li><code>tank_angle</code> and <code>turret_angle</code> are the angles
              of the tank and of the turret in degrees.</li>
            <li><code>angle</code> is the sum of the angle of the turret and the
              tank, modulo 360</li>
            <li><code>energy</code> is your energy level,</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When the event is <code>enemy_spot</code> there is also the field
            <code>enemy_spot</code> in this format:
          </p>
          <pre><code>{
    &quot;id&quot;: 1,
    &quot;x&quot;: 291,
    &quot;y&quot;: 180,
    &quot;angle&quot;: 23,
    &quot;distance&quot;: 202,
    &quot;energy&quot;: 1
}</code></pre>
          <p>where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the enemy location,
            <code>angle</code> is the absolute angle to fire him,
            <code>distance</code> is its distance and <code>energy</code> the enemy
            energy level.
          </p>
          <p>Lastly the <code>data</code> field is a field that you can set with
            your own values with the <code>data</code> command, to save a state for
            further actions.</p>
          <h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
          <p>When you receive an event you decide what to do and give orders to
            the fighter.</p>
          <p>The commands are an array of maps. For example:</p>
          <pre><code>[{
    &quot;move_forwards&quot;: 50,
    &quot;shoot&quot;: true
 },
 {
  &quot;move_backwards&quot;: 50,
  &quot;turn_turret_right&quot;: 180,
  &quot;shoot&quot;: true
}]</code></pre>
          <p>Each map must contains one (and only one) key/value entry describing
            a sequential action. If you specify more than one sequential action,
            only one will be executed (and we do not tell you which one, so do not
            do it!).</p>
          <p>The sequential actions are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>move_forwads: &lt;number&gt;</code>: move forward of the given
              number of pixels</li>
            <li><code>move_backwards: &lt;number&gt;</code>: move backwards of the
              given number of pixels</li>
            <li><code>move_opposide: &lt;number&gt;</code>: move in the opposite
              direction of where you were moving - useful when you hit a wall</li>
            <li><code>turn_left: &lt;number&gt;</code>: turn the tanks to the left
              of the given angle in degrees</li>
            <li><code>turn_right: &lt;number&gt;</code>: turn the tanks to the right
              of the given angle in degrees</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For each sequential action you can also specify a parallel action,
            that is done at the same time as the sequential (that is: the tank can
            fire and move the turret while it is moving in a given direction)</p>
          <p>The parallel actions are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>turn_turret_left: &lt;number&gt;</code>: turn the turret to
              the left of the given angle in degrees</li>
            <li><code>turn_turret_right: &lt;number&gt;</code>: turn the turret to
              the right of the given angle in degrees</li>
            <li><code>shot: true</code>: fires a bullet; note you can fire up to 5
              bullets at the same time</li>
            <li><code>yell: &lt;string&gt;</code>: yell a message that will be
              displayed in the battle field</li>
          </ul>
